Morden high-throughput calculations of materials properties can generate vast amount of data yet locating new and novel materials is no easy task.
We aim to develop methods that can identify new materials using data, domain knowledge and direction exploration of the configuration space and apply them to industrial relevant fields such as energy, optoelectronic and semiconductor materials.

A recurring theme in our approach which set us apart from traditional high-throughput screening is the extensive usage of crystal structure prediction (CSP) techniquesï¼Œ which allow us to access under-explored regions of the chemical space (where existing data are scarce) and also to further validate the global stability of proposed theoretical models.

# Li-ion cathode materials

Cathode is the performance and cost critical component of Li-ion batteries.
Discovering high-capacity and low-cost cathode materials is essential to expand the applications and help increasing the use of sustainable energy sources {% cite zhu_predicting_2022 zhu_accelerating_2021 cen_exploring_2023 %}.

This project combines structure prediction and data-driven materials design to locate potential new cathode materials with earth abundant elements and high capacity.

# Optoelectronics

Optoelectronic materials have a wide range of applications in various fields such as display, lighting, and electronics.

We develop and optimize materials that have potential applications as next generation semiconductor devices and display technologies {% cite han_discovery_2024 grosso_accessible_2023 %}.
